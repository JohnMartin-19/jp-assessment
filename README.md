# jp-assessment

The above project was an assessment test for Backend Dvelopment. Done using Python(Django + DRF). The main goal of the project was to create API endpoints following a set of given data. The project has an admin panel. The credentials of the panel are in the .env file.

# Documentation
I have documented my API endpoints using swagger UI. The endpoint is accessible as stated in the urls.py file.
This is a simple web application that allows the onboarding of customers and their business, adding a customer, editing, updating and deleting a customer entity.
